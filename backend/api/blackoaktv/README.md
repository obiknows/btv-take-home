## GraphQL API (blackoaktv)

The api is available at the url: https://uieor98ejidikf00e.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql.

The data model powered by this api is represented in schema.graphql. Every type is properly represented as a dynamodb table. Queries, Mutations, etc are powered by the function attached inline. Please study closely.

For more details see: https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/graphql/overview/

**N.B**
For the sake of the implementation. This API does not actually work, however your implementation should show how it will or might interact with said api.
